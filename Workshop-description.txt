[h1]Redress Character[/h1]
Allows changing the (at character generation) chosen cosmetic options.
Also allows selecting clothes from a different origin.

[h2]Usage[/h2]
Because the mod is new, stuff is still rough. It works by doing a Character Creation. While you have to complete the character creation, everything besides visual options and origin clothes is ignored.
To use:
[olist]
[*]Click the button in Redress mod section of the UnityModManager GUI.
[*]Go throguh character creation. Pick the cosmetic options you want and the Origin of which you want the clothes (Portrait and Voice aren't changeable; use ToyBox for that).
[*]After finishing, you need to Save and Reload for the changes to take effect.

[h2]Installation[/h2]
Installation is similar to [url=https://github.com/cabarius/ToyBox/wiki/Installing-Toybox-for-RT-(Steam-Workshop-Edition)] how it's done with ToyBox[/url].

While I did say it's an early version, I still have to see whether I will do additional development for the mod.
